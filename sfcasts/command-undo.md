# Undoing Action Commands

There we were... in the middle of a *fierce* battle and... uh, what's that?
We *lost*? *No way*! Our opponent got *super* lucky. Surely there's a way to undo
that operation and try again, right? There *is* - with the *command pattern*.
Our commands only need to remember some *state* about the things that need to be
reverted. In our case, we want to undo the last turn's actions if the player
lost, so they get a second chance to play better and win the battle. Let's do this!

The first thing we need to do is add a new method to `ActionCommandInterface`.
Open that up and, below `execute()`, write `public function undo();` with *no* arguments.

Next, we need to *implement* it in all of our commands. Let's start
with `AttackCommand`. Open that and, up here at the top, we can see that PHPStorm
is already mad at us because it's missing the `undo()` method. To implement that,
click on the interface and press "Ctrl" + "Enter". Select "Add method stubs",
and since the `undo()` method is already selected, we can just press "Enter".
At the bottom, we can see that our method was added. We can leave
our "TODO" comment here for now because we still need to figure out what data
the command needs to remember.

Hold "command" and click on the `attack()` method to go to the definition. Here,
we can see that it consumes some stamina and calculates the attack's damage.
That means we need to remember the player's *stamina* prior to an attack as well
as the damage dealt. *But*, down here, you can see that we're sending the
opposing player damage with `receiveAttack()`. So the value we're *really* after
is the `$damageDealt` variable. Let's go to the top of this class and add those
properties: `private int $damageDealt` and `private int $stamina`.
Inside `execute()`, before the player attacks,
write `$this->stamina = $this->player->getStamina()`, and down here,
write `$this->damageDealt = $damageDealt`. Perfect!

When we undo an attack, we also need to restore the *opponent's* health. To do that,
write `$this->opponent->setHealth($this->opponent->getCurrentHealth() + $this->damageDealt)`.
Now, we need to restore the player's *stamina*,
write `$this->player->setStamina($this->stamina)`. Oh, and we almost forgot to
revert the `fightResultSet`! We don't want to report incorrect data. To revert
the damage *dealt*,
write `$this->fightResultSet->of($this->player)->removeDamageDealt($this->damageDealt)`.
And to revert damage received by the *opponent*,
write `$this->fightResultSet->of($this->opponent)->removeDamageReceived($this->damageDealt);`.
Great! This class is *ready*. Let's keep going!

Open `HealCommand`, and we'll do the same thing here - add the `undo()`
method, click on the name of the interface, and press "Ctrl" + "Enter" and add the stub. Now we
can decide what data we need to remember. This command is simpler - it just
changes the player's health and stamina - so let's store their starting values.
At the top of the class, add both properties: `private int $currentHealth`
and `private int $stamina`. Next, inside `execute()`, before healing the player,
let's save their current health
with `$this->currentHealth = $this->player->getCurrentHealth()`. We'll do the
same for stamina - `$this->stamina = $this->player->getStamina()`.

Now we can implement the `undo()` method. We only need to revert those two
player properties, so write `$this->player->setHealth($this->currentHealth)`
and `$this->player->setStamina($this->stamina)`. Another command *done*! Nice!

Finally, open `SurrenderCommand` and do this one more time - add
the `undo()` method, and hit "Ctrl" + "Enter". We can leave this method empty
because it would be silly to revert a surrender action.

All right! It's time to ask the player if they want to revert the last action in
case of defeat. I'll close a few files and go back to `GameApplication`.
Find the AI's turn, and inside this `if()` where we check if the player died,
write `$undoChoice = GameApplication::$printer->confirm()`. The question will
read:

`You've lost! Do you want to undo your last turn?`.

If the answer is "no", we need to end the battle and exit, so I'll move these
two lines inside the `if`. If the answer is "yes", we *undo* actions from the
last turn, which means that we need to call `undo()` on the command objects. But
we can't just undo these commands in any order. We need to undo them in the
reverse order that they were executed... or weird things could happen. This is
basically a "FILO" stack - "First In, Last Out".

Anyway, let's undo the AI's attack first with `$aiAttackCommand->undo()`. *Then*
we'll undo the player's action - `$playerAction->undo()`. Awesome! Now we can
give this a try. Spin over to your terminal and run:

```terminal
php bin/console app:game:play
```

We'll be an archer this time, and we'll try to lose the battle. Maybe we start
off by healing, and then we'll attack until we *hopefully* lose. And... yes! We
lost! Now it's asking if we would like to undo our last turn. Say "yes" or
press "Enter" and... the game continued! That's a good sign! But to be
absolutely certain that this is working the way it should, let's compare the
amount of health we have now to the amount we had one turn ago.

Okay, right now we have "9/50" and the AI has "50/60". One turn ago, which was
round two, we had "9/50" and the AI had "50/60". The AI *and* our character have
the same amount health in both rounds, so this is working as expected! Nice! And
if we say "no" this time just to see if the battle concludes... yes! The battle
ended and we lost!

## Queuing Command Actions

Thanks to the Command pattern, we were able to revert actions with *ease*. But
that's not the only thing the Command pattern can do for us. We can also use it
to put our actions in a *queue* and execute them whenever we want.

Suppose we want to *replay* our battles and watch everything play out again. We
*could* store *all* of the commands that happened in a battle somewhere, like a
list, database, or any other storage mechanism. *Then*, we grab the list and
execute them one by one. While that would be super fun to work on, we have more
patterns to cover! But before we move onto the next one, let's figure out where
and *how* Symfony leverages the Command pattern. That's *next*.
