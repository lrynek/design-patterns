# Command Pattern in the Real World

Now that we're pros at *applying* the Command pattern, can you guess where
*Symfony* uses it? If you said "Symfony Console", you're right! And, we've been
using it all along. Open up `GameCommand`. We can see that it extends from
this `Command` base class. This belongs to Symfony, and it comes with a bunch of
goodies. Check it out! Hold "command" and click on the class name to open it.
This has *a lot* of stuff, and that makes sense. It needs to handle a lot of
things like options, arguments, and more. It can't be as simple as our commands
because it needs to be extendable and handle a lot of different use cases. Lucky
for us, we're only interested in the `execute()` method. Let's find that and see
what it does. Aha! It does *nothing*. Well, it does force us to implement it,
and that's great because this is our *entry point* to the command system.
Symfony doesn't care what code we put here, so we can do whatever we want. *Cool*!

Another place the Command pattern is used in Symfony is in the *Messenger*
component. It's not *super* obvious because Messenger handles events, queues,
workers, and more, and it leverages other patterns like *middleware*, *event dispatcher*,
etc, but if we pay attention to "Message Handlers", we can tell
that they're pretty similar to our action commands. For example, the constructor
can have *any* dependency, and the `__invoke()` method is our `execute()`
method. Our business logic goes there. The only thing it's missing is an
*interface*. And, by the way, it *used to* have that in a previous version, but it was replaced
by PHP attributes because it's only purpose was to tag the class as a message handler.

## Conclusion

Okay, *that's* the Command pattern! Let's recap what it does:

It is a great way to encapsulate methods into objects. ✅
Allow decoupling the *what* from the *how* and *when*. ✅
Supports *undoable* operations. ✅
And, it leverages the *Single Responsibility Principle* and the *Open/Closed Principle*. ✅

But, it increases code complexity because we're introducing a new layer. ❌
And, as each command requires a separate class, it can introduce a *significant*
number of additional classes. ❌

All right! It's time to *reward* players after a hard-fought battle! *But* there
are different kinds of rewards and only *one* should apply. To do that, we'll
leverage the *Chain of Responsibility pattern*. That's *next*.
